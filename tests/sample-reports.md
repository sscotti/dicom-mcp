# Report 1: Chest CT Follow-up (02-12-2024)

## Indication

Follow-up chest CT for a 62-year-old male with known non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) status post lobectomy and adjuvant chemotherapy. Evaluate for recurrence or metastatic disease.

## Technique

Helical CT acquisition from the thoracic inlet through the adrenal glands after intravenous contrast administration (100 mL Iohexol 350). Reconstructions in axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using both soft-tissue and high-resolution lung kernels.

## Findings

### Lungs and Airways

- Postoperative changes in the right upper lobe consistent with prior lobectomy. Stable fibrotic scarring at the surgical bed.
- No new pulmonary nodules. The previously described 5 mm ground-glass nodule in the left lower lobe is unchanged in size and density.
- Central airways remain patent without mucous plugging.

### Mediastinum and Pleura

- No new mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy. The largest mediastinal lymph node in the subcarinal region measures 8 x 6 mm (previously 8 x 6 mm).
- No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

### Cardiovascular

- Cardiac chambers and great vessels within normal limits. Coronary artery calcifications correspond to known atherosclerotic disease (no significant change).

### Upper Abdomen and Musculoskeletal

- Visualized upper abdominal organs unremarkable.
- No lytic or blastic osseous lesions.

## Impression

No evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. Stable postoperative changes and unchanged 5 mm ground-glass nodule. Continued routine surveillance per oncology protocol recommended.

# Report 2: Chest X-ray (PA and Lateral) (04-15-2024)

## Indication

55-year-old female with fever, cough, and dyspnea. Evaluate for pneumonia.

## Technique

Posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs.

## Findings

- Patchy airspace opacities are present in the right middle lobe and lingular segment of the left upper lobe, consistent with multifocal pneumonia.
- Cardiac silhouette is within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature is not congested.
- No pleural effusion or pneumothorax identified.
- Bony thorax and visualized upper abdomen are unremarkable.

## Impression

Multifocal pneumonia involving the right middle lobe and lingula. Short-term follow-up radiograph recommended after completion of antibiotic therapy to confirm resolution.

# Report 3: Abdominal CT with Contrast (07-22-2024)

## Indication

68-year-old male with colorectal carcinoma, status post segmental colectomy. Evaluate liver for metastatic disease.

## Technique

Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis performed in portal venous phase after intravenous administration of 120 mL Iohexol 350. Axial images reconstructed at 5 mm with coronal and sagittal reformats.

## Findings

### Liver and Biliary System

- Multiple hypoattenuating lesions within the liver consistent with metastases. Dominant lesion in segment VII measures 2.8 x 2.3 cm (previously 2.3 x 2.0 cm). A second lesion in segment IVa measures 1.4 x 1.2 cm (previously 1.0 x 0.8 cm).
- No intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary dilatation.

### Other Abdominal Organs

- Pancreas, spleen, and adrenal glands are unremarkable.
- Kidneys demonstrate symmetric enhancement without hydronephrosis.

### Bowel and Peritoneum

- Postsurgical changes in the sigmoid colon with patent anastomosis. No evidence of bowel obstruction or new peritoneal implants.

### Lymph Nodes and Vasculature

- Stable subcentimeter mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes.
- Abdominal aorta and branch vessels without aneurysm or dissection.

### Musculoskeletal

- No suspicious osseous lesions.

## Impression

Progression of hepatic metastases with interval increase in size of segment VII and IVa lesions. No new metastatic sites identified. Recommend multidisciplinary discussion for adjustment of systemic therapy.

# Report 4: Chest CT Pulmonary Embolism Protocol (09-03-2024)

## Indication

45-year-old female with acute onset chest pain and shortness of breath. Evaluate for pulmonary embolism.

## Technique

CT pulmonary angiography performed after administration of 80 mL Iohexol 370. Images obtained during peak pulmonary arterial enhancement with multiplanar reconstructions.

## Findings

### Pulmonary Arteries

- Segmental pulmonary emboli within the right lower lobe posterior basal segmental artery extending into subsegmental branches.
- No central or saddle embolus. Main pulmonary artery diameter within normal limits.

### Lung Parenchyma

- Peripheral wedge-shaped ground-glass opacity in the right lower lobe consistent with pulmonary infarct.
- Remaining lung parenchyma is clear. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax.

### Mediastinum and Heart

- No right heart strain: RV/LV ratio 0.8.
- Mild cardiomegaly consistent with prior echocardiogram.

### Upper Abdomen and Osseous Structures

- No acute findings in the visualized upper abdomen.
- Osseous structures intact.

## Impression

Acute segmental pulmonary emboli in the right lower lobe with associated pulmonary infarct. No evidence of right heart strain. Immediate anticoagulation recommended. Consider follow-up ultrasound of lower extremities to evaluate for deep venous thrombosis.

# Report 5: Chest X-ray (Portable AP) (11-18-2024)

## Indication

63-year-old male status post right lobectomy now postoperative day 2. Evaluate line placement and postoperative changes.

## Technique

Portable anteroposterior chest radiograph.

## Findings

- Endotracheal tube has been removed. A right-sided chest tube terminates in the right apex; no definite pneumothorax. Surgical clips in the right hilum.
- Right hemithorax demonstrates volume loss and expected postoperative opacity. Left lung is well aerated without focal consolidation.
- Cardiac silhouette mildly enlarged but stable. Mediastinal contours unremarkable.
- No acute osseous abnormalities.

## Impression

Postoperative changes consistent with recent right upper lobectomy. Chest tube in satisfactory position. No pneumothorax or acute complication identified.
